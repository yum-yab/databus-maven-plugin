# DBpedia Ontology instance types
Classification of instances with the DBpedia Ontology

Contains triples of the form ($resource, http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type,
$dbpedia_ontology-class) generated by the mappings extraction. 

The dataset contains a file with just the types as classified with the mapping extractor. These types are normally the most specific class. 
In addition there is one file with the pre-calculated forward-inferences (transitive closure), i.e. with all superclasses. 

If your application/store does not support reasoning, use the _transitive_ file.
