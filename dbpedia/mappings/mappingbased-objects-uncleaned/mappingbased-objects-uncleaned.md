# Mappingbased objects uncleaned
Uncleaned higher-quality object properties refined by the mappingbased extraction.

(Uncleaned) Object properties from the Wikipedia Infoboxes
Uncleaned means that two post-processing steps are missing:
* type consistency, i.e. type of object matches the range of property
* redirecting of objects, i.e. http://dbpedia.org/resource/Billl_Clinton to Bill Clinton
