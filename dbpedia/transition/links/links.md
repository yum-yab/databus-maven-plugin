# Links transition artifact
Republication of https://github.com/dbpedia/links

## Description
https://github.com/dbpedia/links was a preform of the databus, but there were structural weaknesses:
* it was not possible to know, who actually submitted which links, metadata was very bad
* people asked to submit much more, but it was only limited to links

In this artifact, we consolidate all work done here up to Feb 2019 and turn this off as users can now use the databus to upload anything inlcuding the links
There will be no new releases in this transition package
